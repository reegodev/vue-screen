# Upgrading from v1

## Configuration
v2 has brought a few breaking changes on the configuration.
To see how to configure the library please refer to the [configuration section](/vue-screen/guide/configuration/composition-api).<br>

## API

The most notable change from v1 is the separation of the old `screen` object into 2 distinct objects, `screen` and `grid`.
You can check their properties in the [API reference](/vue-screen/api/)
